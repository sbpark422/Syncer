"We stuck together the Ultracortex with a Quest 3, but made space by giving the prefrontal cortex a lobotomy, and then we added a bunch of electrodes, and made a local multiplayer shared experience."

## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

OpenGalea is an open-source project that merges neuroscience and mixed reality to create immersive, brain-controlled experiences. By combining an 8-channel EEG system (based on the OpenBCI Cyton board) with the Meta Quest 3, OpenGalea enables users to interact with virtual environments using their brainwaves. This project aims to democratize neurotechnology, making it more accessible and affordable for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts. OpenGalea offers an accessible and open-source solution for creating valuable datasets and interactive closed-loop visual and auditory experiences that are entirely brain-controlled.

## 2. Project Genesis: MIT Reality Hack <a name="project-genesis-mit-reality-hack"></a>

OpenGalea was conceived and developed during the hardware track at [MIT Reality Hack](https://www.mitrealityhack.com/), a renowned annual hackathon that brings together innovators to push the boundaries of mixed reality, AI, hardware, software, and game development.

## 3. Features <a name="features"></a>

*   **Colocated Mixed Reality:** Supports shared virtual environments where multiple users can interact in the same physical space.
*   **Brain-Computer Interface:** Integrates an 8-channel EEG system for real-time brainwave analysis.
*   **Custom Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes a trained ML model for accurate classification of mental states (e.g., Attention, Relaxation).
*   **UDP Communication:** Facilitates seamless communication between EEG hardware, laptops, and the Quest 3 headset.
*   **Unity Development:** Leverages the Unity platform and Meta XR SDK for creating immersive mixed reality experiences.
*   **Open-Source and Affordable:** Provides a cost-effective alternative to expensive commercial neurotechnology solutions.

## 4. Use Cases <a name="use-cases"></a>

## 9. Running OpenGalea <a name="running-opengalea"></a>

### 9.1 Single-Player Mode <a name="91-single-player-mode"></a>

1.  **Hardware Setup:** Assemble the OpenGalea headset and connect it to your Quest 3. Connect the OpenBCI Cyton board to your laptop.
2.  **Software Setup:**
    *   Launch the OpenBCI GUI and start streaming EEG data.
    *   Run the `main_Attention.py` script from the `Syncer/ML` directory to start the machine learning model and begin real-time inferencing.
    *   Open the OpenGalea Unity project and build/deploy it to your Quest 3.
3.  **Start the Experience:** Launch the OpenGalea app on your Quest 3.

### 9.2 Multiplayer Mode <a name="92-multiplayer-mode"></a>

1.  **Hardware Setup:** Each participant needs a fully assembled OpenGalea headset, a Quest 3, and a laptop.
2.  **Software Setup:**
    *   Ensure all devices are on the same Wi-Fi network.
    *   Launch the OpenBCI GUI on each laptop and start streaming EEG data.
    *   Run the `main_Attention.py` script on each laptop.
    *   Open the OpenGalea Unity project.
    *   Configure the `NetworkManager` in Unity to designate one device as the host and the others as clients.
    *   Build/deploy the app to all Quest 3 devices.
3.  **Start the Experience:** Launch the OpenGalea app on all Quest 3 devices. The host should initiate the shared experience.

## 10. Colocation Implementation <a name="colocation-implementation"></a>
OpenGalea utilizes Meta's Colocation and Shared Spatial Anchors APIs to create shared mixed reality experiences.

*   **Colocation Discovery Initialization**
    *   Devices running OpenGalea utilize Bluetooth-based discovery to identify each other within a range of approximately 30 feet. The Colocation API allows devices to advertise their presence and discover nearby sessions.
*   **Shared Spatial Anchors**
    *   Once devices are connected, shared spatial anchors ensure that virtual objects are consistently positioned within the physical space for all users.
*   **Synchronization**
    *   Maintaining synchronization between devices is crucial for a seamless shared experience. OpenGalea employs various techniques to ensure that all users see and interact with the same virtual objects at the same time.
