# OpenGalea Project

OpenGalea is an innovative platform built using OpenBCI to advance neuroscience research and applications. Our goal is to effectively collect and analyze brainwave and biosignal data, unlocking new possibilities in brain-computer interface (BCI) technologies.

---

## 📌 **Project Goals**
1. Implement a **brain-computer interface (BCI)** based on OpenBCI.
2. Develop **real-time analysis and machine learning models** for biosignal data.
3. Provide a **scalable and user-friendly platform** for researchers and developers.
